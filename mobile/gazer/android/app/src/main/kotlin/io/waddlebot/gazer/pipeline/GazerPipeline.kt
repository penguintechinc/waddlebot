/**
 * Owns the native streaming state machine: builds sources and a StreamEngine from a
 * StreamConfig, drives RootEncoder's ConnectChecker callbacks into Pigeon
 * NativePipelineState/GazerErrorCode events, and wires BitrateAdapter only when the config asks
 * for adaptive bitrate. Every decision beyond "is this config well-formed" belongs to Dart
 * (ReconnectPolicy, source selection) - this class only reports facts and executes commands.
 *
 * Locking contract: `state`/`engine`/`bitrateAdapter`/`adaptiveBitrate` are mutated from both the
 * caller thread (prepare/start/stop/setVideoBitrate) and RootEncoder's own callback thread (the
 * ConnectChecker overrides), so every read/mutation of them is confined to a short
 * `synchronized(lock)` block. Engine calls (prepareVideo/Audio, startStream, stopStream, release,
 * setVideoBitrateOnFly, adaptBitrate) and every `PipelineListener`/`StatsSampler` call are always
 * made *after* leaving that block, never while the lock is held - RootEncoder's stopStream/release
 * can synchronously join its own internal thread, and that thread can turn around and deliver a
 * ConnectChecker callback that needs this same lock, so holding it across an engine call risks a
 * genuine deadlock. Because the lock is never held during a listener call, a `PipelineListener`
 * implementation may safely call back into this pipeline (e.g. `stop()` from within `onState`)
 * without risking deadlock or reentrant-lock surprises. `state` also carries `@Volatile` so a
 * plain read of `pipeline.state` from any thread, without going through the lock, still observes
 * the latest value.
