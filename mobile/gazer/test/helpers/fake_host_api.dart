///
/// Also owns a paired [bridge] (a [NativeEventBridge]) and `emitState`/
/// `emitStats` helpers, so widget/provider tests can drive native-side
/// push events without touching a real Pigeon channel. To wire this up,
/// construct the [PipelineController] under test with `events:
/// fake.bridge` (see Task 12's `pipelineControllerProvider` test) and
/// override `pipelineControllerProvider.overrideWithValue(controller)` —
/// `gazerHostApiProvider.overrideWithValue(fake)` alone does not connect
/// the two, since production `pipelineControllerProvider` constructs its
/// own internal `NativeEventBridge()`.
///
/// `GazerHostApi` is a concrete Pigeon-generated class (its methods talk to
/// a real platform channel), not an abstract interface, so `implements`
/// here must re-declare its two instance fields
/// (`pigeonVar_binaryMessenger`, `pigeonVar_messageChannelSuffix`) in
/// addition to its methods — every method on the real class is also
/// `Future<...>`-returning, which this fake mirrors even where the native
/// side would reply synchronously in spirit (e.g. `getState`).
