## 3. Dependency Management Process

### 3.1 Dependency Classification

WaddleBot uses a mixed dependency strategy for optimal security and stability:

#### Security-Critical Packages (Pinned to Specific Versions)
These packages are pinned to specific secure versions due to their critical security role:

| Package | Purpose | Current Version | Update Policy |
|---------|---------|-----------------|----------------|
| `cryptography` | Encryption/TLS | 41.0.x | Patch + minor releases only |
| `PyJWT` | JWT token handling | 2.8.0+ | Patch releases immediately |
| `bcrypt` | Password hashing | 4.1.2+ | Patch releases immediately |
| `python-jose` | JWT/JWS handling | Latest secure | Patch releases immediately |
| `authlib` | OAuth/OpenID Connect | 1.3.0+ | Quarterly review |
| `flask-security-too` | Authentication framework | 5.4.0+ | Quarterly review |

#### Standard Library Packages (Flexible Versioning)
These packages are version-flexible for better compatibility and feature updates:

| Package | Purpose | Version Range |
|---------|---------|----------------|
| `flask` / `quart` | Web framework | >= 0.19.0 |
| `httpx` | Async HTTP client | >= 0.27.0, < 0.28.0 |

| `pydal` | Database abstraction | >= 20240906.1, < 20250101 |
| `pydantic` | Data validation | >= 2.5.0 |
| `pytest` | Testing framework | >= 7.4.0 |

### 3.2 Update Schedule

**Monthly Cycle:**
- First Monday of each month: Dependency check
- Minor/patch updates for non-critical packages
- Security updates applied immediately
- Changes tested before merge

**Quarterly Cycle:**
- Full security audit of all dependencies
- Major version updates evaluated
- Transitive dependency review
- Vulnerability scanning (Dependabot, pip-audit)

**Annual Cycle:**
- Complete dependency audit
- Removal of unused packages
- Technology stack review
- Planning for version upgrades

### 3.3 Testing Requirements Before Updates

All dependency updates must pass:

1. **Unit Tests**: 100% passing
2. **Integration Tests**: All modules functional
3. **Security Scanning**:
   ```bash
   pip-audit --skip-editable
   bandit -r . -ll
   safety check
   ```
4. **Performance Tests**: No regressions
5. **Manual Testing**: Critical functionality verified

### 3.4 Vulnerability Scanning Tools

Integrated into CI/CD pipeline:

- **Dependabot**: GitHub's built-in dependency vulnerability alerts
- **pip-audit**: Direct dependency vulnerability checking
- **Safety**: Known security issue database
- **Bandit**: Python security linting
- **OWASP Dependency-Check**: Transitive dependency scanning

## 4. Credential Rotation Procedures

### 4.1 Credential Types and Rotation Intervals

| Credential Type | Storage | Rotation Interval | Procedure |
|-----------------|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Database Passwords | Kubernetes Secrets | Every 90 days | Update secret, rolling deployment |
| API Keys (Third-party) | Environment variables | Every 180 days | Generate new, update config, revoke old |
| OAuth Tokens | Secure cache (Redis encrypted) | 1 hour (auto-refresh) | Automatic via OAuth2 refresh flow |
| JWT Signing Keys | Kubernetes Secrets | Every 365 days | Key rotation with grace period |
| SSH Keys | Secured access control | Every 180 days | Generate new, update authorized_keys |
| TLS Certificates | Certificate manager | Before expiry | Auto-renewal (Let's Encrypt) |

### 4.2 Database Credential Rotation

**Procedure:**
1. Generate new database credentials in PostgreSQL
2. Update Kubernetes secret with new password
3. Test new credentials in staging environment
4. Perform rolling deployment (30 seconds downtime)
5. Verify all pods connected successfully
6. Revoke old credentials after 24-hour grace period

**Example:**
```bash
# Generate new password
NEW_PASS=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Update secret
kubectl patch secret postgres-credentials \
  -p '{"data":{"password":"'$(echo -n $NEW_PASS | base64)'"}}'

# Trigger rolling update
kubectl rollout restart deployment/router-service
```

### 4.3 API Key Rotation

**For Third-Party APIs (Twitch, Discord, Slack, etc.):**

1. **Preparation Phase**
   - Schedule rotation window (typically off-peak hours)
   - Notify platform maintainers
   - Prepare new credentials

2. **Implementation Phase**
   - Generate new API keys in provider dashboard
   - Update environment variables in Kubernetes
   - Deploy changes in canary fashion (25% → 50% → 100%)
   - Monitor error rates and logs

3. **Verification Phase**
   - Verify OAuth flows working
   - Test webhook deliveries
   - Check API rate limits
   - Monitor error metrics for 1 hour

4. **Cleanup Phase**
   - Revoke old API keys (24-hour delay for safety)
   - Update documentation
   - Log rotation completion

### 4.4 JWT Key Rotation

**Strategy:** Rolling key rotation with grace period

```yaml
# Old key (grace period: 7 days)
jwt_keys:
  old:
    key_id: "v2"
    algorithm: "HS256"
    revoked_at: "2025-12-02T00:00:00Z"

  # Current key
  current:
    key_id: "v3"
    algorithm: "HS256"
    active_since: "2025-12-09T00:00:00Z"
```

**Rotation Process:**
1. New key generated and marked as "current"
2. Old key marked as "grace period" (7 days)
3. Both keys validate incoming JWTs
4. Only current key signs new tokens
5. After 7 days, old key removed

### 4.5 Emergency Credential Revocation

**Immediate Actions for Compromised Credentials:**

1. **Assessment** (< 5 minutes)
   - Determine scope of compromise
   - Identify affected systems
   - Check audit logs

2. **Immediate Mitigation** (< 15 minutes)
   - Revoke compromised credentials immediately
   - Deploy temporary credentials
   - Block suspicious access patterns
   - Initiate incident response

3. **Communication** (< 30 minutes)
   - Notify security team
   - Inform affected users (if data exposure)
   - Document incident
   - Initiate post-mortem

4. **Recovery** (1-24 hours)
   - Deploy new credentials
   - Verify system functionality
   - Audit logs for unauthorized activity
   - Implement preventive measures
