# WaddleBot Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots of the WaddleBot admin interface and features.

## Capturing Screenshots

### Option 1: Manual Screenshots

1. Start WaddleBot with docker-compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

2. Access the admin portal at http://localhost:8060
   - Note: You may need to expose port 8060 in docker-compose.yml first

3. Login with default credentials:
   - Username: `admin@localhost`
   - Password: `admin123`

4. Take screenshots of key pages and save them here

### Option 2: Automated with Puppeteer

Run the automated screenshot capture script:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the script (requires hub to be running and port 8060 exposed)
node scripts/capture-screenshots.cjs
```

Or use the Docker-based version that works with the internal network:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/capture-screenshots-docker.sh
./scripts/capture-screenshots-docker.sh
```

```markdown
