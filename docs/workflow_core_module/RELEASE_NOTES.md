For users migrating from development/beta versions:

1. **Database Migration**
   ```bash
   # Backup existing data
   pg_dump waddlebot > backup.sql

   # Run migration scripts
   python scripts/migrate_to_v1.py
   ```

2. **Configuration Updates**

   - Add `GRPC_PORT` (default: 50070)
   - Update `SECRET_KEY` and `API_KEY` (required)

3. **API Changes**
   - Execution endpoint now returns `202 Accepted` instead of `200 OK`
   - Webhook trigger moved to `/api/v1/workflows/webhooks/:token`
   - Permission system now uses explicit `can_view`, `can_edit`, `can_execute`

## Known Issues

### Issue #1: Large Workflow Performance

**Description:** Workflows with >100 nodes may experience slower validation times.

**Workaround:** Break large workflows into smaller sub-workflows.

**Status:** Optimization planned for v1.1.0

### Issue #2: Webhook Signature Verification with Binary Data

**Description:** HMAC signature verification may fail with binary webhook payloads.

**Workaround:** Use JSON payloads only.

**Status:** Fix planned for v1.0.1

### Issue #3: Nested Loop Execution Context

**Description:** Variables in nested loops (depth > 5) may not resolve correctly.

**Workaround:** Limit loop nesting to 5 levels or use intermediate variables.

**Status:** Under investigation

---

## Deprecations

None in this release.

## Security Advisories

### SA-2025-001: Webhook Token Exposure

**Severity:** Low
**Description:** Webhook tokens are included in API responses when listing webhooks.
**Mitigation:** Tokens are public by design; use signature verification for security.
**Status:** Not applicable (working as intended)

### SA-2025-002: Expression Engine Sandbox Escape

**Severity:** Critical (Resolved)
**Description:** Potential sandbox escape via `__import__` in expression engine.
**Mitigation:** RestrictedPython updated to v8.0 with hardened globals.
**Status:** Resolved in v1.0.0
