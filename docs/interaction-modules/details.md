# WaddleBot Module Details - Action/Interactive Modules

This document provides comprehensive technical details for WaddleBot action/interactive modules. For core components and trigger modules, see [module-details-core.md](module-details-core.md). For high-level architecture, see [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## Overview

Action modules (Interactive) are response modules that process commands and return chat messages, media displays, or data to users. They communicate with the Router Module for command processing and often integrate with the Browser Source Core Module for OBS displays.

All action modules are deployed as individual Docker containers with Flask/Quart frameworks on Python 3.13.
