# WaddleBot Module Details - Core Components & Trigger Modules

This document provides comprehensive technical details for WaddleBot core components and trigger modules. For action/interactive modules, see [module-details-action.md](module-details-action.md). For high-level architecture, see [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

## Module Architecture Overview

WaddleBot follows a modular, microservices architecture with three primary module categories:

- **Core Components**: Central services handling routing, authentication, identity, and browser source management
- **Trigger Modules (Receivers)**: Platform-specific modules that receive webhooks and events from Twitch, Discord, and Slack
- **Action Modules (Interactive)**: Response modules that process commands and return chat messages, media displays, or data

All modules communicate through the Router Module, which handles command routing, rate limiting, and execution coordination. Modules are deployed as individual Docker containers with Flask/Quart frameworks on Python 3.13.
