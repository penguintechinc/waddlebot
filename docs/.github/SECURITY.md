## Security Best Practices for Users

### Deployment
- Run WaddleBot in containers with read-only root filesystems
- Use a dedicated service account with minimal permissions
- Enable TLS for all connections
- Never commit credentials to version control

### Configuration
- Rotate API keys every 180 days
- Use environment variables for secrets (never hardcode)
- Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
- Enable webhook signature verification
- Keep PostgreSQL and Redis updated

### Monitoring
- Monitor error logs for security events
- Set up alerts for failed authentication attempts
- Track API key usage and rotation
- Review access logs regularly

## Security Updates

- **Monthly Cycle**: Dependency updates reviewed monthly
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Comprehensive security assessments
- **Emergency Updates**: Released immediately for critical vulnerabilities
- **Mailing List**: Subscribe to [security-announce@waddlebot.io](mailto:security-announce@waddlebot.io) for notifications
