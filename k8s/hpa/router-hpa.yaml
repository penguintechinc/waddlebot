# Note: For custom metrics (request rate), enable Prometheus and add this metric:
# - type: Pods
#   pods:
#     metric:
#       name: http_request_duration_seconds_count
#     target:
#       type: AverageValue
#       averageValue: "1000m"  # Scale when avg request rate > 1000 req/s per pod
# This requires:
# 1. Prometheus installed in cluster
# 2. Metrics exposed in /metrics endpoint
# 3. ServiceMonitor or PodMonitor configured
# 4. Prometheus adapter installed to expose custom metrics to HPA
